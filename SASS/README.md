1. Description 
SASS- related exercises in the BeCode training. [Instrctions.](https://github.com/becodeorg/lovelace-2/tree/master/Parcours/04-Sass)

2. Outcomes
I modified the css from the [turlututu](https://github.com/quang-le/progressive-enhancement/tree/master/turlututuv2) to include some sass elements, namely:
* created variables for the custom colors and suppressed the dedicated class when possible (e.g. ` .darkyellow` -> `$darkyellow`)
* created mixins for button border and background colors
* created a mixin for image-width
* nested `@media queries` when possible.
The [result](https://github.com/quang-le/learning-sass/blob/master/turlututuv2/index.html) created no visual change, which was kind of the point.
